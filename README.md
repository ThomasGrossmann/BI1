# BI1 - README

## Description
This project is designed to use the image analysis API from providers such as Google (Vision), Amazon (Rekognition) or Azure (AI Vision).

The user will be able to customize the output by passing an image, the maximum number of results and the minimum level of confidence.

This project also introduces the concept of BI (Business Intelligence) by converting image analysis data into a SQL file that will be stocked on the provider's cloud storage.
